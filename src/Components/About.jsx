        <h1>Hi. I'm Lisa Cee.</h1>

        <p>
          I am a full stack developer passionate about creating websites that
          remove barriers to accessing information and make that information
          readily available to everyone. I am experienced with
          HTML/CSS/JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Node and more after completing an
          intensive 13-month mastery-based program at Lambda School.

            Lisa is a valuable member of any team. She has great curiosity and
            the resolve to find solutions. While her focus is in front end
            development, Lisa has a full stack education in order to better
            understand what makes a site work and how she can make it better.
